This project presents a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb listings in two distinct neighborhoods: Seattle and Stockholm. 
The datasets can be obtained from:

The initial data preprocessing was conducted using Python, ensuring the data is clean, structured, and ready for in-depth analysis. The subsequent visualization and insights are developed using Tableau, divided into three interactive dashboards for an intuitive exploration of the data.

The analysis is structured into four main sections, each delivered through its respective dashboard:

Neighborhood Overview: Provides contextual insights about each neighborhood, including key statistics, distribution of listings, and general characteristics.
Property Trends: Examines property features, such as property types, room types, and availability patterns across both locations.
Pricing Trends: Analyzes price distributions, seasonal variations, and overall pricing strategies within each neighborhood.
Host Analysis: Explores host activity, including the number of listings per host, hosting consistency, and host response behaviors.
